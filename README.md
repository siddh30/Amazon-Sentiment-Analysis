## ***Project Overview***
In this project we carry out Sentimental Analysis on Amazon's Books Dataset based on reviews on a million books and predict whether this review is 'Positive', 'Neutral', 'Negative'. Apart from reviews we have also predicted their individual ratings. We have four different approaches to our project.

The Amazon's Books Dataset containing more than a  million books, thier reviews and their ratings.


## ***Our Apporaches***
Approach 1: Using spaCy for tokenization, Lemmatization and Removing stopwords and using scikit-learn to build our models for different batches of data and using Ensemble Techniques to create an aggregate prediction result.

Approach 2: Using NLTK for tokenization, Lemmatization and Removing Stop words and using scikit-learn to build our models for different batches of data.

Approach 3: Using a custom-built Na√Øve Bayes model.

Approach 4: Handling Big Data using pyspark.
